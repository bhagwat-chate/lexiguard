# 🛡️ LexiGuard – Vision & Execution Blueprint (FAANGM-Grade)

## 🎯 Project Vision

**LexiGuard** is a compliance-aware GenAI system designed to analyze legal and organizational AI policies (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, DPDP) and provide:
- Structured, verifiable answers to regulatory queries
- Risk classification with citation and hallucination detection
- Actionable next steps with responsible team tags
- Guardrails-enforced, JSON-compliant outputs

It is designed to solve the **real-world gap between GenAI output reliability and legal auditability** for enterprises and AI governance teams.

---

## 🧠 Core Use Case

Enterprises need to ensure their AI systems comply with evolving global regulations. Legal teams struggle with:
- Finding specific clauses across large documents
- Mapping laws across regions (GDPR ↔ DPDP)
- Tracking changes between policy versions
- Getting structured answers they can forward internally

LexiGuard acts as a **compliance assistant**, capable of:
- Answering “Is this use case compliant with GDPR Article 6?”
- Flagging hallucinated legal references
- Recommending next steps (“Consult DPO”, “Amend policy X”)
- Logging every query, eval score, and risk for audit

## 🏗️ System Architecture (FAANG-Grade Modular)

```
User → FastAPI → AutoGen Orchestrator
     → Retrieval Layer (Hybrid Search, Qdrant)
     → AnswerGen Agent
     → Eval Agents (Faithfulness, Toxicity, Citation)
     → Guardrail Schema Validator
     → Actionability Engine
     → JSON Output + Logs
```

All responses adhere to `ComplianceResponseModel` and pass through multi-stage validation.

## 🚧 Agent Layer (AutoGen-Orchestrated)

| Agent Name                     | Responsibility                                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| query_parser_agent            | Parse question into intent & scope                        |
| retriever_agent               | Hybrid RAG (vector + BM25) chunk fetch                    |
| llm_answer_agent              | Generate initial response using OpenAI or Cohere          |
| citation_checker_agent        | Ensure referenced clause exists                           |
| risk_classifier_agent         | Tag with LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL                   |
| faithfulness_eval_agent       | RAGAS score for answer-to-context fidelity                |
| toxicity_eval_agent           | TruLens or moderation API for toxicity/harmful bias       |
| output_guardrail_agent        | Enforce output schema via Pydantic & Guardrails.ai        |
| actionability_agent           | Suggest follow-up & responsible actor                     |
| hallucination_explainer_agent| Explain if & why hallucination occurred                   |
| jurisdiction_expander_agent  | Map clause to other jurisdictions (e.g., DPDP equivalent) |
| version_comparator_agent      | Track policy version changes                              |
| logger_agent                  | Log everything: query, output, eval, flags                |

## 🧱 Development Plan (Execution Blueprint)

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Lock folder structure
- [x] Setup `shared/` with configs, prompts, logs, assets
- [ ] Create `schema.py`, `enums.py`, `llm_config.yml`
- [ ] Implement 4 critical agents: parser, retriever, answer, guardrail

### 🔹 Phase 2: Evaluation Layer
- [ ] Add RAGAS + TruLens validators
- [ ] Add `citation_checker_agent` and `risk_classifier_agent`
- [ ] Test hallucination scenarios + logging

### 🔹 Phase 3: Expansion & Comparison
- [ ] Add `jurisdiction_expander_agent`
- [ ] Add `version_comparator_agent`
- [ ] Add PDF visualizer or clause navigator

### 🔹 Phase 4: Productization
- [ ] API Swagger docs + healthchecks
- [ ] Eval dashboard (streamlit or notebook)
- [ ] LinkedIn series + YouTube walkthrough
